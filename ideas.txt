Sever: The servers should be simple and scalable
- sendfile() syscall. If server knows the size of the file it can use sendfile
  to send and recv file
- server should not know what it is storing. For example if dfs1 is storing
  chunks 1 and 2 it should not be aware of this, the client should know the
  details.
- server should not know the filename only the hash
