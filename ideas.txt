Sever: The servers should be simple and scalable
- sendfile() syscall. If server knows the size of the file it can use sendfile
  to send and recv file
- server should not know what it is storing. For example if dfs1 is storing
  chunks 1 and 2 it should not be aware of this, the client should know the
  details.
- server should not know the filename only the hash
- server needs to response to 3 things 
    - get  -> if server has file send it back to client
        int server_get(int connfd, char file_name[33]) {
            - get file size
            - open file_name read only
            - get shared_lock on fd
            - sendfile from fd to connfd
            - unlock fd
        }
    - put  -> server saves the file to its dir
        int server_put(int connfd, char file_name[33], size_t file_size) {
            - open file_name exclusive create write only
            - get exclusive lock on fd
            - sendfile from connfd to fd
            - unlock fd
        }
    - test -> server checks if the file exists
        int server_test(int connfd, char file_name[33]) {
            open file_name read only
        }
